# Virtual-Memory-Simulator
Implemented a virtual memory simulator in understanding of the behavior of a TLB, page table, and the page replacement algorithms. 
This code can simulate a Page Table, three page Replacement Algorithm, and two-way associative TLB table with LRU algorithm for replacement.
